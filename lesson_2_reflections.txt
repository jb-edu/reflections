What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  It gets ready to accept files within the folder as part of the 
  repository. I.e. creates a new repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  It gives you a temporary location to organize how you want the
  repository to be structured before committing anything. It has the value
  of allowing you to easily back out any changes where mistakes were made.
